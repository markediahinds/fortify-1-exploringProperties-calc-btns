# Exploring Properties and Design

This entire directory is on exploring and understanding the properties in web development and how they affect our designs. It's crucial to move beyond simply copying code; instead, we aim to foster a habit of curiosity and deep understanding. Discovering what a property does, the different values it can assume, and the impact of those values on your design is at the heart of engineering and creativity.

## Directory Structure

This directory is organized into three subdirectories, each designed to enhance your learning experience:

- **0-guided**: This is where your learning journey begins. 
  
- **1-button**: Dedicated to practical application, this section focuses on creating buttons. It's an opportunity to apply what you've learned and experiment with design and functionality.
  
- **2-calculator**: Here, you'll put your skills to the test by building a calculator. This project not only reinforces what you've learned but also introduces new concepts related to positioning. It's a chance to see how your learning can be applied to create functional, practical applications.

## Guidance

Each section comes with a `README.md` file, which contains specific instructions and guidance for the tasks at hand. Reading these files is crucial; they're designed to guide you through the learning process, providing direction and clarity. Remember, a significant part of a developer's job involves reading and understanding documentation, so this practice is invaluable.

## Resources

To support your journey, we've included a `RESOURCELIST.md` file in this directory. This resource is intended to help you create unique button designs and assist with your calculator project. 

## Focus on Design

As you progress through this directory, emphasize creating clean, aesthetically pleasing designs. Developing a keen eye for design and attention to detail is essential in the modern tech career market. Curiosity and the willingness to go above and beyond will set you apart. If you're not pushing yourself to learn and explore, you're missing out on the essence of being a developer in today's world.
